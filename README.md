## Overview
This project will focus on property price growth rates by suburb over the past 20 years (depending on available data). Specifically we will analyse sales data for each NSW suburb from 2001 to 2021 so as to exclude the "pre-GST" prices which saw prices increase by 10% overnight. 

Once we have established sound code to display sales price growth for Castle Hill over the past 20 years, we will then attempt to repeat this process for all NSW suburbs.

## Dashboard
With all the sales price data for every suburb in NSW we can then develop code to build a dashboard/panel to compare selected suburbs against each other to see which one or more suburbs growth outperformed others over that period. 

We hope that our dashboard will provide reliable backtesting of suburb property price growth to enable investors to see trends in the property market which may provide more confidence in their future investment decisions.

## Additional Features
If we have enough time, we would like to build on our dashboard to include all Australian suburbs. Future development could also compare other asset classes such as: 

  Australian shares, Australian bonds, International shares, Internation bonds, the most popular ETFs, top 10 cryptocurrencies, term deposits and cash.
